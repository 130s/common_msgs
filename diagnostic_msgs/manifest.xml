  <description brief="A package for diagnostic_msgs">

     This package holds the diagnostic messages which provide the
     standardized interface for the diagnostic and runtime monitoring
     systems in ROS. These messages are currently used by
     the <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/diagnostics">diagnostics</a>
     Stack, which provides libraries for simple ways to set and access
     the messages, as well as automated ways to process the diagnostic
     data.
     <li>
     These messages are used for long term logging and will not be
     changed unless there is a very important reason.
     </li>
